# IB Gateway Docker
## Step-by-step Instructions

### Installing IB Gateway (optional)
- Download the stable version for Linux x64 [here](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ibgateway-stable.php)
- Place the file `ibgateway-stable-standalone-linux-x64.sh` inside the installer folder, naming it `ibgateway-<VERSION_NUMBER>-linux-x64.sh`

## Running ib-gateway:
This relies on [gnzsnz](https://github.com/gnzsnz)'s [ib-gateway-docker](https://github.com/gnzsnz/ib-gateway-docker) repository.
1. Clone the repository to desired machine.
2. Create a .env in the root of the reopository.
3. Inside this file, copy the following, change userName and passWord:
```
TWS_USERID=userName
TWS_PASSWORD=passWord
# ib-gateway
#TWS_SETTINGS_PATH=/home/ibgateway/Jts
# tws
#TWS_SETTINGS_PATH=/config/tws_settings

READ_ONLY_API=no
VNC_SERVER_PASSWORD=myVncPassword
TWOFA_TIMEOUT_ACTION=restart

SSH_ALIVE_INTERVAL=

SSH_PASSPHRASE=
SSH_REMOTE_PORT=
SSH_USER_TUNNEL=
SSH_RESTART=
SSH_VNC_PORT=
```
4. Run docker-compose up

### Laptop Performance Issues
If you're on a laptop, or older desktop, and you noticed Docker is taking significant resources, try going to %UserProfile%\ and creating (if it does not exist) .wslconfig and adding to it:
```
[wsl2]
memory=2GB
```
Changing it as necessary to limit the total memory Docker will use.

### Accessing the IB-Gateway
Make sure you connect with the API on `127.0.0.1:4002` for paper trading (`:4001` for live tradingâ€”see __NOTE__ above).
